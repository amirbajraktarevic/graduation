# GRADUATION PROJECT

## Corona Track Application

This is my Graduation Project, an application for tracking and updating status of citizens based on their current COVID status.

### The client folder consists of the frontend and the server folder is the backend part

You can run the backend by navigating to the server folder and entering `npx nodemon app.js` in the terminal.
You can run the frontend by navigating to the client folder and entering `npm install` to install the project dependencies, then `npm start` in the terminal.

## ** Hope you enjoy **
